# RARE Lab PRA Solver (Beta)

## Overview
The RARE Lab PRA Solver quantifies a PRA model consisting of an event tree and fault trees. It provides detailed output in XML format.
If you find any issues with the program, please post them on the [ISSUES](https://github.com/tsakuraharapitt/Pitt-RARELab-PRA-Solver/issues) page. 

## Disclaimer
This software is a **preliminary beta version** and has not been verified or validated. This tool is provided for **educational purposes only**.
- **Do not** rely on this tool for real-world or safety-critical decision-making.  
- Use the results with caution, as the code may contain errors or limitations.

## Requirements
- **Python version**: 3.6 or later
- **Dependencies**:
  - `sympy` (for Boolean algebra operations)

## Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsakuraharapitt/Pitt-RARELab-PRA-Solver.git
cd RARELab-PRA-Solver
```
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.
### 2. Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
### Run the Program:
```
python RARE-PRASolver-v0.1.py
```
### Provide Input: 
When running the program, the following prompt will be displayed. Then, enter the path/name of an XML input file (e.g., sample_input.xml):
```
Please enter the path to the XML input file: sample_input.xml
```
If the input file is located in the same directory, only the file name is required. The entire file path must be entered if the input file is placed in a different directory. 
### View Results:
Output data are stored in another XML file that will be created in the same directory.
```
Results are saved to sample_input_output.xml.
```
### Example Input
Hereâ€™s an example of an XML input file:
```
<PRAModel>
    <Scenarios>
        <Scenario name="S1" Outcome="major failure">IE*A</Scenario>
        <Scenario name="S2" Outcome="minor failure">IE*_A*B</Scenario>
        <Scenario name="S3" Outcome="minor failure">IE*_A*_B*C</Scenario>
        <Scenario name="S4" Outcome="success">IE*_A*_B*_C</Scenario>
    </Scenarios>
    <InitiatingEvent>
        <Probability>0.05</Probability>
    </InitiatingEvent>
    <TopEvents>
        <Event name="A">a*b + c*d</Event>
        <Event name="B">a*e + c*f</Event>
        <Event name="C">a*g</Event>
    </TopEvents>
    <Probabilities>
        <BasicEvent name="a">0.1</BasicEvent>
        <BasicEvent name="b">0.1</BasicEvent>
        <BasicEvent name="c">0.1</BasicEvent>
        <BasicEvent name="d">0.1</BasicEvent>
        <BasicEvent name="e">0.1</BasicEvent>
        <BasicEvent name="f">0.1</BasicEvent>
        <BasicEvent name="g">0.05</BasicEvent>
    </Probabilities>
</PRAModel>
```
Here, the underscore ("_") before each event represents a complement of each event. For instance, "_A" represents "not A" in Boolean logic. 
### Example Output
The program produces an XML output file, for example:
```
<Output>
  <Scenario name="S1" Outcome="major failure">
    <MinimalCutSets>(IE &amp; a &amp; b) | (IE &amp; c &amp; d)</MinimalCutSets>
    <Probability>9.950e-04</Probability>
  </Scenario>
  <Scenario name="S2" Outcome="minor failure">
    <MinimalCutSets>(IE &amp; a &amp; e &amp; ~b &amp; ~c) | (IE &amp; a &amp; e &amp; ~b &amp; ~d) | (IE &amp; c &amp; f &amp; ~a &amp; ~d) | (IE &amp; c &amp; f &amp; ~b &amp; ~d)</MinimalCutSets>
    <Probability>8.870e-04</Probability>
  </Scenario>
  <Scenario name="S3" Outcome="minor failure">
    <MinimalCutSets>(IE &amp; a &amp; g &amp; ~b &amp; ~c &amp; ~e) | (IE &amp; a &amp; g &amp; ~b &amp; ~d &amp; ~e &amp; ~f)</MinimalCutSets>
    <Probability>1.987e-04</Probability>
  </Scenario>
  <Scenario name="S4" Outcome="success">
    <MinimalCutSets>(IE &amp; ~a &amp; ~c) | (IE &amp; ~a &amp; ~d &amp; ~f) | (IE &amp; ~b &amp; ~c &amp; ~e &amp; ~g) | (IE &amp; ~b &amp; ~d &amp; ~e &amp; ~f &amp; ~g)</MinimalCutSets>
    <Probability>0.047919</Probability>
  </Scenario>
  <OutcomeTotals>
    <Outcome name="major failure">9.950e-04</Outcome>
    <Outcome name="minor failure">1.086e-03</Outcome>
    <Outcome name="success">0.047919</Outcome>
  </OutcomeTotals>
</Output>
